README-EVAL
===========

Home repository for the README-EVAL evaluation system

The ACL 2014 Semantic Parsing workshop abstract describing what README-EVAL is about is available here [Towards README-EVAL : Interpreting README File Instructions](http://acl2014.org/acl2014/W14-24/pdf/W14-2415.pdf).

README-EVAL has not been implemented yet which is why there is no code or data here.
The code that does exist is an RPM distro file extractor and browser.  
That code ([PackageExtractor](https://github.com/jimwhite/ReadIt/tree/master/PackageExtractor) and [PackageIndexer](https://github.com/jimwhite/ReadIt/tree/master/PackageIndexer)) is in the ReadIt repository and should work with 
most any Fedora RPMS distribution.  That data is not reproduced here because it is fairly large
when unpacked (~35GB for Fedora Core 17).

Please subscribe to this repo and/or send me an email if you're interested in this project and would
like to use README-EVAL.
